# Work Day Scheduler

## As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. In specific, this Work Day Scheduler needs to include the following criteria: 
  1. When you open the planner, the the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
  2. When you scroll down the planner, you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
  3. The time blocks are colour coded to indicate whether it is past, present, or future.
  4. When you click a time block, you are able to enter an event.
  5. When you click the save button for the specified time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
  6. When you refresh the page, the saved events persist on the planner.

The following screenshot is a preview of the Work Day Scheduler I created.
